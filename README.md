## Problem

Building on the work done in my first Capstone Project, use CurationCorp’s labelled news database a to create a neural net-based topic classification and make this functionality available via a cloud-based API. 


## Client

My client is CurationCorp.com. This project is the first step in a machine-learning-based classification, tagging and auto-summary project that should be able the company to automate much of its editorial process, and reserve human intervention for final edit and sign-off instead of low-level textual processing tasks.

## Data

CurationCorp has a clean, human-curated database of 43,502 summarised and labelled news articles, to which I have access. For raw source data, I’ll be using a sample of data from a standard news database (LexisNexus Moreover, format: CSV) or the news aggregator dataset at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator.

## Approach

1.	Data wrangling2.	Compare Classifiersa.	A multi-layer neural net (NN)b.	A convolutional neural net (CNN)c.	A long/short term memory neural net (LSTM)d.	A very deep convolutional neural net (VDCNN) 3.	Build a prediction API
