Tens of thousands of little things, as it turns out.\\nMondragon is head psychologist at HireVue, which markets software for screening job candidates. Its flagship product, used by Unilever and Goldman Sachs, asks candidates to answer interview questions in front of a camera. Meanwhile its software, like a team of hawk-eyed psychologists hiding behind a mirror, takes note of barely perceptible changes in posture, facial expression and vocal tone.\\n\\u201cWe break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,\\u201d says Mondragon. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes.\\u201d\\nThe program turns this data into a score, which is then compared against one the program has already \\u201clearned\\u201d from top-performing employees. The idea is that a good prospective employee looks a lot like a good current employee, just not in any way a human interviewer would notice.\\nApproaches like vocal analysis and reading \\u201cmicroexpressions\\u201d have been applied in policing and intelligence with little clear success. But Mondragon says automated analyses compare favourably with established tests of personality and ability, and that customers report better employee performance and less turnover.\\nHireVue is just one of a slew of new companies selling AI as a replacement for the costly human side of hiring. It estimates the \\u201cpre-hire assessment\\u201d market is worth $3bn (\\u00a32.2bn) a year.\\nA study in the UK last year found an average of 24 applicants per low-wage job. Tesco, the country\\u2019s largest private employer, received well over three million job applications in 2016. With applications rising, employers have automated as much of the process as possible. This started more than a decade ago with simple programs that scanned text CVs for key words. It has now expanded to include quizzes, psychometric tests, games and chatbots that can reject applicants before a human ever glances at their CV.\\nJobseekers are forced to prepare for whatever format a prospective employer has chosen, a familiar power shift in the gig economy era. And without human interaction or feedback, an already difficult process has become deeply alienating.\\nBeyond the dehumanising experience lurk the usual concerns that attend automation and AI, which uses data often shaped by inequality. If you suspect you\\u2019ve been discriminated against by an algorithm, what recourse do you have? How vulnerable are those formulas to bias? And is it inevitable that non-traditional or poorer candidates, or those who struggle with new technology, will be excluded from the process?\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employer,\\u201d says Robert, a plumber in his 40s whom I met at a weekly jobs club in London. He uses job boards and recruiters to find temporary work. Harry, 24, has been searching for a job for four months. In retail \\u201cjust about every job opening\\u201d requires a test or game. He completes four or five a week. The rejections are often instant, piling up without a word of feedback. Every time you start again from zero.\\n\\u201cYou never know what you\\u2019ve done wrong. It leaves you feeling a bit trapped,\\u201d Harry says.\\nThe problem is worst for older jobseekers. Many rely on support from councils or voluntary services to help them fill out applications. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who was a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?\\u201d asks Lynda Pennington, who organises another jobs club in Croydon.\\nAfter 86 unsuccessful job applications in two years \\u2013 including several HireVue screenings \\u2013 Deborah Caldeira is thoroughly disillusioned with automated systems. Without a person across the table, there\\u2019s \\u201cno real conversation or exchange\\u201d, and it\\u2019s difficult to know \\u201cexactly what the robot is looking for\\u201d, says Caldeira, who has a master\\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics.\\nDespite her qualifications, she found herself questioning every movement as she sat at home alone performing for a computer. \\u201cIt makes us feel that we\\u2019re not worthwhile, as the company couldn\\u2019t even assign a person for a few minutes. The whole thing is becoming less human,\\u201d she says.\\nA fightback against automation has emerged, as applicants search for ways to game the system. On web forums, students trade answers to employers\\u2019 tests and create fake applications to gauge their processes. One HR employee for a major technology company recommends slipping the words \\u201cOxford\\u201d or \\u201cCambridge\\u201d into a CV in invisible white text, to pass the automated screening.\\nMeasures are under way to tip the balance of power back to those seeking work, according to Christina Colclough, director of digitalisation and trade at UNI Global Union, a federation of trade unions. They include a charter of digital rights for workers touching on automated and AI-based decisions, to be included in bargaining agreements.\\nAn imminent update to the EU general data protection regulation will require a company to disclose whenever a decision that \\u201csignificantly affects an individual\\u201d has been automated. But even minimal human involvement \\u2013 approving a list of automatically ranked CVs, for example \\u2013 could exempt companies from such regulations, warns Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute.
